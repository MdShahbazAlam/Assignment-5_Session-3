View(titanic_data)              
boxplot(titanic_data$fare~titanic_data$pclass, outline = F, data = Titanic, 
        col = c("grey", "yellow", "blue"),
        xlab = "Class of Ticket", ylab = "Fares", 
        main = "Fares For Different Passenger Class")

titanic_data <- read.csv(file="Titanic.csv", header= TRUE, sep=",")
View(titanic_data)
counts <- table(titanic_data$PClass, titanic_data$Sex)
bp <- barplot(counts, col= rainbow(length(counts)),
              las=1,
              cex.names = 1.5,
              main = "Passenger class and gender",
              xlab = "Gender", ylab = "Class of Ticket")
legend("topleft",
       c("1st Class", "2nd class", "3rd Class"),
       fill = c("Red", "Yellow", "lightgreen"))
print(bp)

# The number of male passenger in each class in more than the number of female passenger.
